# Data

**Abstract**

We use two real data sets in our paper. The first one is an scRNAseq data set, which contains expressioons of a total of 400 T47D A1-2 human breast cancer cells. This data set contains 400 samples in the control group, in which the cells are vehicle-treated, and 400 samples in the treatment group, in which the cells are treated with 100 nM synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). After proper normalization, the final scRNAseq data consist of 800 samples, each with  expressions of 32,049 genes.

**Availability**

The scRNAseq data is available at

**Description**

The datasets are explained in Section 5.3 of the paper.

# Code

**Abstract**
